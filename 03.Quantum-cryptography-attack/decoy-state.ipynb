    "# Decoy State Protocol for Secure QKD\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **decoy state protocol** is a crucial enhancement to weak coherent state (WCS) QKD that provides information-theoretic security against photon number splitting (PNS) attacks. While WCS systems are practical and cost-effective, they suffer from a fundamental vulnerability: multi-photon pulses enable eavesdropping without detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Security Problem with WCS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Photon Number Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "For a weak coherent state with average photon number $\\mu$, the probability of having exactly $n$ photons follows a Poisson distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_n(\\mu) = \\frac{\\mu^n e^{-\\mu}}{n!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with $\\mu = 0.1$:**\n",
    "- $P_0(0.1) = e^{-0.1} \\approx 90.5\\%$ (vacuum pulses)\n",
    "- $P_1(0.1) = 0.1 \\times e^{-0.1} \\approx 9.0\\%$ (secure single-photon pulses)\n",
    "- $P_{\\geq 2}(0.1) \\approx 0.5\\%$ (vulnerable multi-photon pulses)\n",
    "\n",
    "### PNS Attack Vulnerability\n",
    "\n",
    "Eve can perform an undetectable attack by:\n",
    "1. **Intercepting** multi-photon pulses\n",
    "2. **Splitting** photons and keeping some for herself\n",
    "3. **Forwarding** remaining photons to Bob\n",
    "4. **Measuring** her stored photons after basis reconciliation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all photons in a coherent state carry the same information, this attack gives Eve perfect knowledge without introducing errors.\n",

    "## Decoy State Solution\n",

    "- $Q_{\\mu_i}$ = **observed detection rate** for intensity $\\mu_i$\n",
    "- $P_n(\\mu_i)$ = **Poisson probability** of $n$ photons\n",
    "- $Y_n$ = **detection efficiency** for $n$-photon states\n",

    "### System of Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "With multiple intensities, we obtain a system of equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_{\\mu_s} = P_0(\\mu_s)Y_0 + P_1(\\mu_s)Y_1 + P_2(\\mu_s)Y_2 + \\cdots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_{\\mu_d} = P_0(\\mu_d)Y_0 + P_1(\\mu_d)Y_1 + P_2(\\mu_d)Y_2 + \\cdots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_{\\mu_v} = Y_0$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The lower bound on single-photon detection probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_1^{(L)} = \\frac{\\mu_d Q_{\\mu_s} - \\mu_s Q_{\\mu_d}}{\\mu_d - \\mu_s} \\times \\frac{e^{\\mu_d - \\mu_s}}{\\mu_s \\mu_d (e^{-\\mu_s} - e^{-\\mu_d})}$$\n",
